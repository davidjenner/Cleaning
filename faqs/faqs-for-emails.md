# FAQs for Emails

### General response SLA

* **When does the business operate and when to expect an email response?**

Generally between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. is the best time to send us an email and we will aim to get back to you within 48 working hours. Unfortunately, at the moment we have limited capacity to respond to most emails quickly and frequently; unless it's urgent or serious, in which case, please let us know it's urgent and we'll try to get back to you within 24 working hours.

If your query is information only, doesn't require an answer, has been answered in the FAQs or is an outsourcing email offering (as below), please appreciate you might not get a response unless we have extra time available.

### Outsourcing Services Offerings

* Are you interested in outsourcing any web design/development or SEO/marketing work?

All of this type of work is being run in-house for the foreseeable future and not looking to outsource for the time being as the site. This includes all services such as web design and development any coding language, Google organic or Paid SEO / App development, copywriting and so on and so forth. If you've emailed us about any of these, please understand that our time is limited to respond to these and the answer will almost certainly be a 'Thank you but no thanks'. Thank you for your understanding and for kindly respecting our wishes on this matter.
