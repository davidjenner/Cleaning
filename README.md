# FAQs for Cleaners

(**I apologise in advance for any of my typos at the moment)**

* **Where in the area are cleaners expected to go and do cleaning jobs?**

In the Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch areas, if the clients and customers are happy perhaps some areas such as Wimborne or Ferndown as well.

* **The website is down, are you still operating?**

If it says 'There's been a critical error' or 'Connection is not private' this is either a technical glitch on the website or the security certificate needs renewing and needs a 5-minute fix.&#x20;

* **I see that the website is still fairly new, do you expect I will get cleaning jobs, and how often?**

The website has only recently been taking shape to be operational, however, the website has been live for a while and does have a presence in Google and is getting visitors. Please be patient as there are still a few things to be ironed out and everything is being done to help get you some cleaning jobs before too long.

To get a look at what is being worked on behind the scenes you can take a look at the Trello Board - [https://trello.com/b/XfPLCu1b/bournemouth-clean-roadmap](https://trello.com/b/XfPLCu1b/bournemouth-clean-roadmap)

* **How much shall I charge for my cleaning jobs?**

Please charge a fair rate for all the effort you will be putting into the work, too low and people will not expect much or appreciate your work and may not bother hiring you at all. Also, bear in mind there will be at least a Â£10 admin fee added on top of any bookings made.

Even if you want to charge a lower rate to start off with to help you get work and the company get more revenue, while this is appreciated, this might still come across in the wrong way.&#x20;

* **How should my photos look for adding to the website?**

Please add clear and professional photos of yourself where you're in a clean and tidy room of your house without any emojis, special effects or filters. If you want to have a photo of yourself cleaning a room this is great and a smile doesn't hurt either.

* **How can I update my listing?**

Please fill in the form again to add yourself as a cleaner and I will remove your previous listing&#x20;
